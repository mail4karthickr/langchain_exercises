## 🧠 Understanding MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) in LangChain Retrieval

### 🔍 What is MMR?

**Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)** is a smart retrieval strategy that balances **relevance** and **diversity** when selecting documents from a vector store.

Instead of just returning the top `k` similar documents (which might be redundant), MMR tries to:
- **Maximize relevance** to the query
- **Minimize redundancy** among the selected documents

This helps improve the **quality of retrieved context**, especially for **summarization** or **question answering (RAG)** tasks.

### ⚙️ How MMR Works

MMR works in two main steps:

1. **Retrieve** the top `fetch_k` documents by cosine similarity (like standard similarity search).
2. **Select** the final `k` documents by reranking them using the MMR formula:

```
MMR(doc) = λ * Sim(doc, query) - (1 - λ) * max(Sim(doc, already_selected_docs))
```

Where:
- `Sim(doc, query)` is the cosine similarity between the document and the query.
- `Sim(doc, already_selected_docs)` is the maximum similarity between this doc and any doc already selected.
- `λ` (lambda) controls the balance:
  - Closer to 1 → More emphasis on relevance
  - Closer to 0 → More emphasis on diversity

### ✅ Benefits of MMR

| Feature     | Benefit                          |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| 📌 Relevance | Still selects high-quality docs |
| 🔄 Diversity | Avoids repetitive info          |
| 🧠 Smarter   | Better context for LLMs         |

### 🆚 MMR vs Similarity Search

| Aspect                | `similarity`                            | `mmr`                                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Selection              | Top `k` by cosine similarity             | Reranks `fetch_k` to pick diverse top `k`      |
| Relevance              | ✅ High                                  | ✅ High                                         |
| Redundancy             | ❌ High chance of duplicates             | ✅ Reduced via diversity scoring                |
| Performance            | ✅ Faster                                | ❌ Slightly slower (extra reranking)           |
| Use case               | Simple search                            | RAG, Summarization, Complex QA                 |

### 🧪 Example in LangChain

```python
# Similarity search (pure cosine similarity)
similarity_retriever = chroma_db.as_retriever(
    search_type="similarity",
    search_kwargs={"k": 3}
)

# MMR search (cosine + diversity)
mmr_retriever = chroma_db.as_retriever(
    search_type="mmr",
    search_kwargs={
        "k": 3,         # Final number of results to return
        "fetch_k": 10   # Initial candidates to consider before reranking
    }
)
```

### 💡 When to Use MMR?

Use MMR if:
- You want **diverse** context chunks
- You're building **RAG pipelines**
- You noticed **redundancy** in retrieved documents

Use simple similarity if:
- You want **maximum relevance**, and redundancy is acceptable
- Speed is a critical factor

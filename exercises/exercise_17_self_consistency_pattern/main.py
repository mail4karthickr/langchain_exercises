            1. **Understand the problem**: Briefly explain what the question is asking.
            2. **Plan the solution**: Outline the logic or algorithm you will use.
            3. **Write the Swift code**: Provide the full, correct Swift function.
            4. **(Optional)** Add a short test example to demonstrate how the function works.

        # üß† Self-Consistency Pattern in Prompt Engineering

        ## üìñ Definition
        The **Self-Consistency Pattern** is a prompt engineering technique where a language model is asked to solve the same problem multiple times (with randomness enabled), and the most frequently occurring answer is selected as the final output. This helps overcome occasional errors in reasoning by leveraging statistical consensus among multiple completions.

        It is especially effective when used with **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** prompting, where the model is encouraged to reason step-by-step.

In basic terms, it is a measurement of how much liquid and waste is passing from the blood through the tiny filters in the kidney, called the glomeruli, and out into the urine during each minute. The test measures how much creatinine is in the blood. This shows how well the kidneys are performing. In a normal healthy person the GFR stays close to the same value all of the time. The test is done by taking blood from a person and sending it to a laboratory. Normal values are between 90ml/min and 110ml/min. A value below 60ml/minute means the person has chronic renal disease and a value below 15ml/minute means the person's kidneys have stopped working.", "Measurement of the GFR can be very helpful to medical professionals. It helps them decide if a person has a disease of the kidneys or not. A normal value for GFR is between 90-110ml/min. This will normally go down in older people. It will also go down in people with kidney disease. As well as helping a medical professional diagnose a kidney disease, the GFR is also used to monitor the progress of a disease.", "The test begins by taking blood from a person's veins. The most common places are the vein in the elbow and the veins on the back of the hands. People usually feel a sharp stinging pain when the needle enters their skin. After the blood is drawn out, it is sent to a medical laboratory where a laboratory technician calculates the GFR. It is possible to calculate an exact value for the GFR but this is rarely done any more. Most of the time, the value is estimated (this is called an eGFR). The basis for this estimate is a chemical in the blood called creatinine. The calculation may also include things such as gender, age, height, weight, and race. Getting an exact measurement needs more tests and special equipment. Doctors now normally use the estimated GFR with signs, symptoms and the medical history given by the patient to come to a diagnosis. A final diagnosis of kidney disease may sometimes be made by a pathologist using tests such as a kidney biopsy."]}

Werner Heisenberg stumbled on a secret of the universe: Nothing has a definite position, a definite trajectory, or a definite momentum. Trying to pin a thing down to one definite position will make its momentum less well pinned down, and vice-versa. In everyday life we can successfully measure the position of an automobile at a definite time and then measure its direction and speed (assuming it is coasting along at a steady rate) in the next few moments. That is because the uncertainties in position and velocity are so small that we could not detect them. We assume, quite correctly, that the trajectory of the automobile will not be noticeably changed when we drop a marker on the ground and click a stopwatch at the same time to note the car's position in time and space.", "We may bring that experience to the world of atomic-sized phenomena and incorrectly assume that if we measure the position of something like an electron as it moves along its trajectory it will continue to move along that same trajectory, which we imagine we can then accurately detect in the next few moments. We need to learn that the electron did not have a definite position before we located it, and that it also did not have a definite momentum before we measured the trajectory. Moreover, we may justifiably assume that a photon produced by a laser aimed at a detection screen will hit very near to its target on that screen, and confirm this prediction by any number of experiments. Next we will discover that the more closely we try to pin down some location for the electron on its way toward the detection screen, the more it and all others like it will be likely to miss that target. So pinning down a location for an electron makes the trajectory more indefinite, indeterminate, or uncertain. If the trajectory were made more clear and then we were to try to locate that electron along an extension of the trajectory we just staked out, then we would find that the more precise we made our knowledge of the trajectory, the less likely we would be to find the electron where ordinary expectations would lead us to believe it to be. If pitchers threw electrons instead of baseballs, and an overhead camera and side-facing camera were placed somewhere between the pitcher's mound and home plate so that the exact position of the electron could be determined in mid flight, then without the cameras being turned on, the pitcher would throw straight balls, and with the cameras turned on his pitches would start out straight but gyrate wildly after their pictures were taken.

By the mid-nineteenth century, her works were respected by people who were learned in literature. They thought that liking her works was a sign that they were clever. In 1870, her nephew published \"Memoir of Jane Austen\". This showed her to a wider public as \"dear, quiet aunt Jane\". After this, her works were published again in popular editions. By the twentieth century, lots of groups had formed. Some praised her and some defended her from the \" masses\". However, they all claimed to be true Janeites, or people who really appreciated Austen.", "Early in the twentieth century, scholars made a collection of her works (the first for any British novelist). But it was not until the 1940s that Austen was widely accepted as a \"great English novelist\".

The university English departments began developing in the first half of the twentieth century. As they grew, criticism of Austen split into remarkable high culture and popular culture trends. In the late twentieth century, fans made Jane Austen societies and clubs. They praised Austen, her time, and her works. In the early twenty-first century, Austen fans support an industry of printed sequels and prequels. They also support Austen's work in television and film."]}

The previous tsar Tsar Ivan IV was known as \u201cIvan the Terrible\u201d. He was terribly cruel and the Russian people suffered badly under his rule. They were hungry, they were tortured and killed. When he died his son became Tsar, but he was mentally retarded (he had \u201clearning difficulties\u201d) so a group of powerful people including Boris Godunov had to rule for him. Ivan also had another son, but he disappeared.

He ruled as a regent from about 1585 to 1598 and then as tsar from 1598 to 1605. In many ways he was a good tsar, but he had not inherited the throne. He became more and more anxious that a pretender would come who would claim to be Dmitri, the son of the previous tsar, Ivan IV (Ivan the Terrible) and try to get the throne. Dmitri had actually been murdered. The story of Boris Godunov is told in Pushkin\u2019s play \"Boris Godunov\" and in Mussorgsky\u2019s opera \"Boris Godunov\", but the story told by Pushkin and Mussorgsky is probably not exactly how it really happened.

The Tsar killed his eldest son. When the Tsar died he had a son Dmitry who was only two years old. Dmitri was not allowed to become tsar, because he was the son of Ivan\u2019s 7th marriage, and the rules of the Russian Orthodox Church were that no one should be allowed to marry more than three times (of course, no one had dared to try to stop Ivan from all those marriages). So Fyodor became Tsar Fyodor I. He was not bright enough to rule himself. We would probably say that he was mentally disabled, or that he had \u201clearning difficulties\u201d. Boris therefore became regent: he ruled for him. Some boyars were against Boris, but Boris somehow managed to silence them. In some ways Boris did a good job. He made Russia a safer place, fighting back the Tatars in the south and making strong contacts with Europe. He built towns and fortresses, made sure that Western Siberia was firmly under Moscow\u2019s control, and made the head of the Muscovite Church a patriarch. In 1598 Fyodor died and Irina should have become Tsarina, but she refused and went to live in a convent. The boyars voted for Boris to become Tsar.", "At first everything went well, but in 1601-1603 the harvest was bad and many poor people starved. The people became angry with the Tsar, because he had made very strict rules which took away the rights of the serfs (most of the poor people were serfs). There were still several royal families in Russia. They started to plot against Boris because they saw him as a threat to themselves. Boris got lots of spies to watch these families. He accused the families of treason and sent some of them to Siberia or to monasteries in the north or Russia. One of these families were the Romanovs who were later to produce a long line of tsars."]}

By carefully making the fields bigger as the particles gain energy, the width of the circular path can be kept the same as the machine accelerates the particles. This allows the vacuum chamber for the particles to be a large thin circular pipe torus (donut shape). It is easier to use some straight sections between the bending magnets and some bent sections within the magnets giving the torus the shape of a round-cornered polygon. A path that acts like a very large circle can be constructed using simple straight and curved pipe segments, unlike the disc-shaped chamber of the cyclotron type devices. The shape also requires the use of multiple magnets to bend the particle beams. Straight sections are required at spacings around a ring for both radiofrequency cavities, and in third generation setups space is allowed for insertion of energy extraction devices such as wigglers and undulators. Most synchrotrons use two types of magnets: dipole magnets to bend the particle beam and quadrupole magnets to focus the beam.", "The maximum energy that a cyclic accelerator can impart is typically limited by the strength of the magnetic field(s) and the minimum radius (maximum curvature) of the particle path.

Their operation is based on \"locked\" randomness, stemming from tiny imperfections (mistakes) in the manufacturing process of hardware, which result in the production (output) of a bit-string which appears random and can be considered as unique per hardware instance (device).", "Essentially, in each PUF circuit, electric current may move through this circuit in two distinct ways/paths, such as two wires. If it goes mostly through one of these ways/paths, a logical zero is produced, whereas if it goes through the other way/path, a logical one is produced. The prevalent path is chosen according to tiny details (characteristics) of the circuit, such as which wire is thicker or longer. However, the two wires have been designed to be exactly the same, and only differ because of imperfections of the manufacturing process, which cause random tiny mistakes (imperfections), such as one wire being 5 mm, and the other 5.00001 mm. Therefore, and as the choice of the prevalent path is dependent on a large number of tiny details (thickness, length, resistance of the wires, etc.), which are very difficult to determine beforehand, this choice appears as random, and can be considered as chaotic. The tiny production mistakes that affect the path choice cannot be predicted as they happen randomly in the manufacturing process. Nevertheless, after they happen, they stay like that, for example, the small difference in length between two wires will always exist after they have been manufactured, so the aforementioned path choice is \"locked\", although it is \"random\" (chaotic), and will always give the same result.", "Since most contemporary hardware devices consist of millions of circuits, millions of individual choices can be made at the same time, resulting in a string (series) of bits (zeros and ones) of a very large length. Since each choice is independent and \"random\", the probability that two such strings will be the same becomes extremely small due to their very large length. Therefore, a PUF can be used to produce a large bit-string that will be \"unique\" per device and always the same, when measured under exactly the same conditions. Such a bit string can then be used in cryptography as an inherently occurring cryptographic token, such as a key for encryption. As external (environmental) conditions may affect the result of a PUF (its \"random\" unique bit-string output), error correction may be needed to force this result to be the same between different measurements."]}

The UDP still lost the election and was once again send into Opposition. However, this time they had a majority to form a Shadow cabinet headed by Leader of the Opposition, Dean Barrow. Barrow appointed Faber as Shadow Minister of Education (Science and Technology). He served in that position from 6 March 2003 to 8 February 2008, after the UDP won the election. As a Shadow Minister, Faber often argued with Education Minister, Francis Fonseca on education policies for the Country. He also accused Fonseca of \u201cunable to do his job properly as the Minister of Education and that he should be fired from the Cabinet\u201d. Faber\u2019s name became publicly known in March 2005 during the Unrest surrounding the Musa administration Budget, Public utilities and Corporation woes. In 2006, Faber campaigned heavily for the UDP in the Municipal elections and delivered collet once again. He sought to present the PUP as heartless, corrupt, greedy and incapable of responsibility. All those words, surged the UDP into a landslide victory in the Election. On 29 November 2007, Faber appeared in a interview alongside Area Rep for Mesopotamia constituency, Michael Finnegan. Both of them criticised the Musa Government in which Barrow wanted Finnegan to be the next Minister of Police and the Army. The PUP used that Interview and sharply criticised Finnegan and other UDP Shadow Ministers as \u201cno team, no talent\u201d. In September 2007, Faber was endorsed once again as UDP Standered-Bareer for Collet constituency. Faber was in for a 3-way race again facing PUP Chariman, Carolyn Trench-Sandiford and Patrick Rogers of the newly formed Vision Inspired by the People (VIP). Both Faber and Sandiford were now considered Stalwards so it was harder for Faber to convince his people for a second term. Nevertheless, Faber campaigned this time alongside Finnegan, Barrow and Shadow Minister of Public Service, John Saldivar. Together the UDP won Collet and a landslide victory in the 2008 election. Surprisingly, Faber won 1,596 votes and 57.26% of the vote, a even more handsome victory than 2003. Sandiford won 1,008 votes and 39.05% while Rogers garnered 77 ballots and 2.76%. Following the UDP landslide, Faber was selected as Minister of Education (Science and Technology) by Prime minister, Barrow. On 27 January 2009, in a meeting of the House of Representatives (Belize), Faber crtizised Opposition Leader, Johnny Brice\u00f1o in regards to the Environmental protection act. Faber said that the comments made by Brice\u00f1o were \u201cbordering and ridiculous\u201d. He also said that the Government understands that Businesses has to pay for collection of their garbage and some private businesses however Small they are taking matters into their own hands and not going contrary to the Law. Going into the 2009 municipal elections, Faber assisted Belize City Mayor, Zenaida Moya in campaigning in her bid for re-election. With a well-fought campaign, the UDP municipal slate won the City. On 16 May 2009, Faber participated in a Dancing Event in his division. Several Youths attended and it was a blast. In 2009, Faber was appointed as Youth Director and President of the YPF. On 1 September 2010, UDP Chairman, Doug Singh resigned after serving in that Position 10 years. This triggered a convention within the Party which was scheduled on 1 August 2010. Both Faber and Saldivar submitted their Nominations to contest the position. Singh\u2019s successor at the end of the count would turn to be Faber. He won with a whopping 422 votes over 122 votes for Saldivar. He was elected overwhelmingly to the Role of Party chairman. This was the first time the two counterparts are Facing off, but it\u2019s certainly not the last. For the victorious Faber, he was expecting the Victory, only not by that overwhelming margin. Faber said that to ensure Victory he has to take Initiative but he denies that it included manipulation."]}

Battle royale games usually have a large number of players, ranging from tens to hundreds, that start with almost nothing who then try to defeat all other enemies/players while trying to stay inside of a play zone or \"safe area\" that gets smaller over time.

The name for the genre is taken from the 2000 Japanese movie \"Battle Royale\", which has a similar theme of a last-man-standing competition in a shrinking play zone.", "The genre's origins arose from mods for large-scale online survival games like \"Minecraft\" and \"ARMA 2\" in the early 2010s.

In each match, the goal is to be the last player or team standing by defeating all other enemies. A match starts by placing the player-characters into a large map space, typically by having all players skydive from a large aircraft within a short time limit. The map may have the players randomly placed or allow players to have some control over where they start. All players start with very little equipment, giving no player an obvious advantage at the start. Equipment, usually used for fighting, survival or transport, is randomly placed around the map, often at landmarks on the map, such as within buildings in ghost towns. Players need to search the map for these items while trying to avoid being killed by other players, who cannot be visually marked or revealed either on-screen or on the map, making the player use only their own eyes and ears to find their positions. Equipment from defeated players can usually be taken as well. These games often include some mechanic to push enemies closer together as the game progresses, usually taking the form of a safe zone that slowly gets smaller, with players outside of the zone eventually being killed."]}

Each day over a yearly cycle the shadow will be different from the day before, and the shadow is specific to the location of the dial, particularly its latitude. The dial is designed to tell local apparent time so the longitude is not important. In this case, noon will be at the point when the sun is highest in sky and due south, and standard time would be when the sun was due south at another point such as the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. Derby is at 1\u00b0 28\u2032 46.2\u2033 West of Greenwich, so the sun is approximately 5 mins and 52.05 s later in reaching noon. And also when telling the time, we must consider the equation of time. That is to say, as the earth moves around the sun in a slight ellipse, day length slightly varies everyday. For example, the difference from the average becomes up to 16\u00a0minutes in November and February. This equation of time had been really unknown for a long time until people started comparing sundials with mechanical clocks. If a clock ignores this difference, it measures average time. If a clock is re balanced each day to make them correspond with the natural cycle, it measures local mean time. A fixed noon and fixed day are essential for railways timetabling, so Greenwich Mean Time was adopted. In the case of Midland Railway, it was by January 1848."]}
